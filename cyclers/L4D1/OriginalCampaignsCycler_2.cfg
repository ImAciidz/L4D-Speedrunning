// To rearrange the sequence, ONLY update BOTH instances of the campaign name seen in the first 6 entries below.  //
// To vote for the campaign currently selected in sequence, the command is "CampaignVote".                        //
// To reset the sequence back to the beginning, the command is "CampaignReset".                                   //
// To advance the sequence by one campaign without voting, the command is "CampaignNext".                         //
// To revert the sequence by one campaign without voting, the command is "CampaignPrev".						  //
// To reset the first map of a campaign if the cutscene doesn't skip, the command is "CampaignCurrent".           //
// See the bottom of this script for examples on how to bind these properly to a key.                             //
// Use "exec OriginalCampaignsCycler_1" in the console or autoexec to activate this script.                       //
// Chat has a short cooldown so if campaigns are rotated too quickly it may not print the text, but it did work!  //

// If confused on how to change your order, check out https://github.com/ImAciidz/L4D-Speedrunning/wiki/Campaign-Cyclers or ask in the speedrunning Discord
// Basically just change both instances of a number to another (change both instances of 01 to 03, and change both instances of 03 to 01, for example)

// THIS IS WHAT DEFINES THE CAMPAIGN ORDER
alias Campaign01 DeathToll;		alias Campaign01Say "say Death Toll selected"
alias Campaign02 BloodHarvest;	alias Campaign02Say "say Blood Harvest selected"
alias Campaign03 NoMercy;		alias Campaign03Say "say No Mercy selected"

// DO NOT TOUCH THESE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING

alias Campaign02Next "alias CampaignVote Campaign03; Campaign03Say; alias CampaignNext Campaign03Next; alias CampaignPrev Campaign03Prev"

// REPLACE THE "YOURKEYHERE" WITH THE KEY YOU WANT. NUMPAD BINDS ARE PREFIXED WITH "KP_". ASK IN DISCORD IF YOU NEED HELP

//bind YOURKEYHERE "CampaignVote; CampaignNext; vote yes" 	// Votes the campaign in the sequence, rotates to the next one, and votes yes (useful for co-op)
//bind YOURKEYHERE "z_difficulty Impossible; CampaignReset"// Votes for the first campaign, resets the sequence, and votes yes (useful for co-op)
//bind YOURKEYHERE CampaignNext 					 		// Advances the sequence forward to prime it for voting
//bind YOURKEYHERE CampaignPrev 							// Reverts the sequence backward to prime it for voting
//bind YOURKEYHERE CampaignCurrent                         // If cutscene plays, use this alias to reload map
