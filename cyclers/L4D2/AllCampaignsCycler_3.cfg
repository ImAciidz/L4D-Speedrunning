///////////////////////////////////
// ALL 14 CAMPAIGNS VOTE CYCLER  //
///////////////////////////////////



////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// To rearrange the sequence, ONLY update BOTH instances of the campaign name seen in the first 14 entries below. //
// To vote for the campaign currently selected in sequence, the command is "CampaignVote".                        //
// To reset the sequence back to the beginning, the command is "CampaignReset".                                   //
// To advance the sequence by one campaign without voting, the command is "CampaignNext".                         //
// To revert the sequence by one campaign without voting, the command is "CampaignPrev".                          //
// See the bottom of this script for examples on how to bind these properly to a key.                             //
// Use "exec AllCampaignsCycler_1" in the console or autoexec to activate this script.                            //
// Chat has a short cooldown so if campaigns are rotated too quickly it may not print the text, but it did work!  //

// If confused on how to change your order, check out https://github.com/ImAciidz/L4D-Speedrunning/wiki/Campaign-Cyclers or ask in the speedrunning Discord
// Basically just change both instances of a number to another (change both instances of 01 to 03, and change both instances of 03 to 01, for example)
